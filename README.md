## History
A few years ago two colleagues at 4DotNet worked at a customer where Scrum was just being introduced. Along with Scrum, they also started to do planning poker sessions to estimate their work. As the team kept growing, there soon weren't enough cards in the deck to let everyone join in.

This is where they decided one night to roll a multi-player, web application to accomodate for the planning poker sessions. To this day, the application in still being used! But it was never properly maintained.. That is why we have now decided to open-source it.

## What is all this magic?
The code is now open-source for you to use. We are very open to PRs, which are automatically built against our CI pipeline. When we decide your contribution is in order, it will be merged at the earliest convience and from there will automatically be live at.. TBD 

## Disclaimer
The code was written in one night, and there might be some drinks involved. In its current state it is far from pretty, please don't hold it against us.
